						Germans attacked Britain because Hitler wanted to attack Britain. After all, the British

						did
						not want Britain to recover Britain's army, and he started to invade Britain because he
						wanted
						to make
						their military weaker; he also wanted to capture all of Britain because he did not want to have
						any other country that is against him. That way, he invaded the whole of Europe without
						stopping or getting defeated by another
						country.

						<h2>How did Canada support Britain during the Battle of Britain aside from sending pilots?
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Canada supported the British by forcing the Canadians to join the war and become pilots. They
						also forced French Canadians to join the war to support Britain against the Germans. RAF had
						reinforced their planes and pilots by increasing the number
						of pilots going to war and having upgraded weapons, engines, and papers in their
						planes; that way, they could be of high quality and robustness.
						When the year was 1940, Ahoust 30 RAF started to attack 100 enemy planes, and they had 12
						Victoires when they get rid of 100 enemy planes. </p>

						<h2>
							What challenges did Canadian pilots face while participating in the Battle of Britain?
						</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						1. Point Germany attacked from the air. They wanted to destroy the ARF(Royal Air Force). When
						they
						destroyed the RAF, they could control the English Channel. When they had control of the English
						Channel, Germany could send their navies to Britain. That way, the navy and German airforces
						could boom Britain, and the British could surrender to Germany.
					</p>
					<p>
						2. When Canadian pilots felt high pressure because they were doing risky jobs like the plane
						can cause damage, or when the plane goes too high, the motor of the aircraft can cause serious
						damage and that damage can cause the motor to burn because they feel stress(pressure).
